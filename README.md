# C-sharp-project
Current Problems :
- List will save double and load double values
- Phone Number is a string, was going to implement area code but didn't have enough time
- Can only search with first name.

Most of the problems I had with this project was figuring out a native C# way to save and load data for the address book. I spent some time looking at JSON, then XML and went back to a simple txt file which isn't ideal for a text book.

What would I add :
- A GUI for easy navigation
- Search only works via names, no alternative search methods
- Fix existing bugs
- Implement a better loading solution
